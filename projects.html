<i>Funded by</i>: <a href="https://www.zitis.bund.de/" target="_blank">ZITiS (Central Office for Information Technology in the Security Sector)</a> &nbsp; &nbsp; <i>Role</i>: PI<br>
<p>SCANDIUM is a 3-year project, funded by ZITiS (Central Office for Information Technology in the Security Sector). 
The project explores methods to improve cooperation between German law-enforcement agencies that face complex and resource-intensive investigative tasks. 
Although these agencies are willing to collaborate, strict regulations prevent them from sharing sensitive information directly. 
As a result, coordination must be achieved in a way that respects confidentiality while still enabling efficient use of limited resources.

In this project PACY Lab works with ZITiS on the design of secure multi-party computation protocols aiming to reduce redundant work across the agencies by 
detecting overlaps in large confidential datasets without revealing their contents. By ensuring that efforts are not duplicated, 
the approach aims to optimize the allocation of resources and shorten the overall time required to complete such investigative processes.

<p>The aim of TargetSat is to explore cyber security challenges for new space scenarios involving COTS-based satellites and satellite constellations. 
The project work led to the journal article "<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10207-020-00503-w" target="_blank">Cyber Security in New Space</a>" which analyses past satellite security threats and highlight key enabling technologies and associated security challenges in connection with new space.
A long-term goal ois to develop a COTS-based testbed capable of emulating RF communications between satellite constellations (incl. inter-satellite links) and the ground segment. 
The testbed will be built using single-board computers and software-defined radios to support the design and evaluation of protocols for satellite constellations.

<i>Funded by:</i> <a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/" target="_blank">NCSC</a> (National Cyber Security Centre) &nbsp; &nbsp; <i>Role:</i> PI<br>
<p>This project focuses on the design and demonstration of a secure control system for ground-controlled missions involving fleets of consumer drones. 
Off-the-shelf consumer drones are repurposed for secure drone-to-drone and drone-to-ground communications by appropriate non-invasive modifications to the original software running 
on the drones. The project uses reverse-engineering techniques along with open-source software available for the drones and modifies the latter to achieve the desired functionality. 
The designed control system ensures end-to-end security of drone control messages (e.g. based on MAVLink protocol) exchanged between the ground control and the fleet and of mission-specific payloads (e.g., video streams, photographs, etc) 
collected by the swarm. As part of experimental research activities, a prototype has been built and demonstrated on an open land. A paper summarising the work is available <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.05064" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<i>Funded by:</i> <a href="https://www.epsrc.ac.uk/" target="_blank">EPSRC</a> (Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council) &nbsp; &nbsp; <i>Role:</i> Co-I<br>
<p>The aim of TAPESTRY is to investigate, develop and demonstrate transformational new technologies to enable people, businesses and digital services to connect safely online, 
exploiting the complex "tapestry" of multi-modal signals woven by their everyday digital interactions; their Digital Personhood. In this way we will de-risk the Digital Economy, 
delivering completely new ways of determining or engendering trust online, and enabling users and businesses to make better decisions about who they trust online. 
From a technological standpoint, the project will develop the decentralised infrastructure necessary to make sense of the vast number of digital interactions using multimodal 
signals aggregated via machine learning from social media and IoT interactions. Additionally, new cryptographic strategies will be needed to secure the privacy of trust 
evidence and to disseminate access on a granular basis. From a HCI and co-design perspective, the development of trust services and the shift to use of the digital personhood and 
interaction history as trust evidence will break new ground, fundamentally altering the way users think about identity and interaction online. This multi-disciplinary project 
includes academic partners from the University of Surrey (CVSSP, SCCS, 5GIC), University of Dundee (DJCAD), and University of Northumbria, and is supported by industry.</p>

<p>The project PRIMAKE aims at the design of advanced cryptographic protocols for authentication, key establishment, 
and secure communication in various networks and applications that in addition to the classical computation 
of session keys will preserve privacy of their participants. The goal of PRIMAKE is to provide à la carte 
solutions for privacy-preserving secure communications. PRIMAKE protocols will address several flavors of 
privacy such as affiliation-hiding, attribute-hiding, and deniability. They will be usable in arbitrary 
multi-user applications with minimalistic trust requirements and be suitable for resource constraint devices such as smart phones. 
PRIMAKE protocols will have formal proofs of security and privacy, obtained using standard cryptographic models.</p>

<p>Unlike classical digital signatures, group-oriented signatures (GOS) assume that the signature generation process is related to some group or formation of users. 
GOS schemes come in different flavors, depending on the assumed setting and security requirements. Examples of GOS include multisignatures, aggregate-signatures, 
threshold signatures, group signatures, ring signatures, etc. This project will extend current GOS models and constructions with new properties driven by practical applications.</p>

<i>Funded by:</i> <a href="http://www.daad.de" target="_blank">DAAD</a>, ATN Programme &nbsp; &nbsp; <i>Role:</i> PI (German side)<br>
<p>The project UMA with CRYPO and Queensland University of Technology in Australia as partners aims to design and implement practical, efficient, and user-centred cryptographic protocols for 
user authentication in higher security applications involving multiple authentication secrets – so called multi-factor authentication. 
Due to the increasing risks of phishing and malware on Internet-connected devices such as personal computers, mobile devices, and public terminals, 
traditional single-factor authentication (usually performed via passwords) no longer suffices to protect sensitive applications such as 
online banking, e-government, and corporate remote network access. This project will explore a new approach for user authentication by employing the use of 
multiple factors and communication channels in a secure and usable manner.</p>

<li><a id="GruPA"></a><strong>2011 (8m) &nbsp; &nbsp; Group Signatures: Privacy-Preserving Authentication Methods</strong> <br>
<i>Funded by:</i> <a href="https://www.bsi.bund.de/" target="_blank">BSI</a> (German Federal Office for Information Security) &nbsp; &nbsp; <i>Role:</i> PI<br>
<p>Group signatures are cryptographic privacy-preserving authentication mechanisms. 
Potential signers are formed into a group, which is managed by a usually centralized authority (group manager). 
Each group member being in possession of a (valid) membership certificate can sign documents on behalf of the whole group. 
In addition to various forms of unforgeability the distinguished privacy property of group signatures is that they 
do not leak any information about the actual signer, except for the validity of the signer's membership in the group. 
In case of dispute the group manager can, however, identify the signer and possibly prove this fact to a third-party.   
The concept of group signatures was introduced in 1991 by Chaum and Van Heyst and many more schemes appeared since then. 
The goal of the project is to reflect the state-of-the-art in this field by providing a comparative study of existing group signatures, 
thereby focusing on their security and privacy properties, cryptographic strength, performance, and practical relevance.<br><br>
The outcome of the project is the <a href="https://www.bsi.bund.de/DE/Publikationen/Studien/GroupSignatures/GruPA.html" target=_blank>study</a> published by the German Federal Office for Information Security.</p>

<i>Funded by:</i> <a href="http://www.bmbf.de" target="_blank">BMBF</a>, WTZ Australia Programme &nbsp; &nbsp; <i>Role:</i> PI (German side)<br>
<p>The project POC with CRYPO and Queensland University of Technology in Australia as partners aims at the design of novel cryptographic protocols 
for secure online communications that go beyond the classical notion of secure channels (e.g. TLS). 
Given that privacy on the Internet is one of the major concerns today, the next generation of secure channels must be 
equipped with appropriate mechanisms for preserving privacy of communication participants, yet ensuring the traditional requirements of confidentiality and authenticity.
In addition to the development and appropriate security and privacy analysis of new protocols, 
POC uses modern cryptographic methods to investigate the relationship amongst the different notions of privacy in online communications in a formal way.</p>

<i>Funded by:</i> <a href="http://www.daad.de" target="_blank">DAAD</a>, ARC Programme &nbsp; &nbsp; <i>Role:</i> PI (German side)<br>
<p>The project PACU with CRYPO and Royal Holloway, University of London in UK as partners aims at the design and implementation of efficient cryptographic protocols for privacy-preserving 
communication and authentication amongst users based on their attributes. Due to the increasing popularity of 
collaborative Internet applications such as online communities (social networks, peer-to-peer systems, 
instant messaging applications, etc.) there is strong demand to protect personal data from unauthorized access and use. 
The difficulty is that hiding personal information is problematic from the perspective of authentication, 
which is needed to ensure that communicating users are indeed those who they pretend to be. 
The project PACU investigates novel cryptographic approaches where identities of users are replaced with 
properties (or attributes) that users may possess in order to perform authentication in a privacy-friendly way. </p>
